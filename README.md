# PyTorch Models
My implementations of some popular models using PyTorch:
1. [LeNet-5](http://vision.stanford.edu/cs598_spring07/papers/Lecun98.pdf): ```raw_MNIST_LeNet_5.ipynb``` is a sample notebook that implements a variant of LeNet-5 and train it from the scratch using the MNIST dataset loaded from Keras :).
2. [GoogLeNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.4842.pdf): ```DataLoader_CIFAR10_tinyGoogLeNet.ipynb``` is a sample notebook that implements a variant of GoogLeNet that has fewer numbers of Inception module and train it from the scratch using the CIFAR10 torchvision dataset.
